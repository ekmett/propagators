propagators
===========

[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/propagators.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/propagators) [![Build Status](https://github.com/ekmett/propagators/actions/workflows/haskell-ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/ekmett/propagators/actions/workflows/haskell-ci.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)

Propagators propagate increases in information from cell to cell.

They are described (using Scheme) in Alexey Radul and Gerald Sussman's ["The Art of the Propagator"](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6.945/readings/art.pdf) as well as in Alexey Radul's thesis on [Propagation Networks](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/genesis/papers/radul%202009.pdf).

This package explores design options for propagators in Haskell. The primary innovation here (beyond the published work) is the use of observable sharing to let us take a more direct form of programming and transform it back and forth to the propagator style.
